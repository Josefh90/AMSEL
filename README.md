# AMSEL — Automated Module for Security Exploitation & Logging

AMSEL is a modular offensive security tool designed to automate common tasks during penetration testing — from exploitation to detailed logging. The goal is to bring clarity, control, and customization back into your own hands, whether you're a security enthusiast or a seasoned red teamer.

# 🧠 Why this project?
Years ago, I paid for what was supposed to be a professional pentest. All I got in the end was a one-page summary with little transparency about what was actually done. No real insight, no steps, no value. I thought: “This can't be all there is. Why can't I just do this myself?”

So I did.

# 🐦 Why the name AMSEL?
Funny enough, the name comes from my cat. One day she had a loud argument — through the window — with a blackbird (Amsel in German) sitting on a fence. It was like watching a heated debate in the animal world. From then on, we jokingly called her “the Amsel”.

Years later, when I started building this tool, the name came back to me. Not just because it’s catchy or ironic, but because I really love this cat — smart, adaptable, and always alert. Just like a good security tool should be.
